Photoshop has a 3D functionality which isn't that great. In fact, it's horrible. But at least it *worked* for simple things, like mockups.

Adobe announced that those features are [being discontinued](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/3d-faq.html#discontinued-photoshop-3d-features). Reasons and such in that link.

There are no plans to introduce 3D features back in Photoshop. Such a shame. 3D mockups have proven to be very useful for the creative community. A lot of potential lost.

Frustrated â€“ and motivated! â€“ by those news, I made **ZMOK**: a 3D mockup renderer that works with Photoshop files (PSDs).

Have you used a Photoshop mockup before? Basically, it's the same. You don't have to learn anything new :). Just open the .ZMOK file that comes with the assets and you're ready to go!

ZMOK works better. Has more features. It is faster. And nicer ðŸ˜Ž

# I want to make my own 3D mockups!

Good news is that this app is free and open source. You are totally free to use it in your projects and to make your own 3D mockups for your assets store or private purposes.

The bad news: I didn't take the time to document the process of making ZMOK mockups. [Reach me out](https://martyr.shop/pages/contact) and let me know that you're interested. That might fill my interest in making a proper documentation :)
